## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Build Application
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "d:\VS new healthy1"

# Make scripts executable (if on Linux/WSL)
chmod +x deployment/*.sh

# Build application for production
./deployment/build.sh
```

### Step 2: Upload to Server
```bash
# Option A: Automated upload (recommended)
./deployment/upload.sh YOUR_SERVER_IP YOUR_USERNAME

# Option B: Manual upload
scp -r nutrition-platform frontend/ deployment/ user@server:/tmp/nutrition-deploy/
```

### Step 3: Server Deployment
```bash
# SSH to server
ssh user@your-server

# Run deployment script
cd /tmp/nutrition-deploy
sudo ./deployment/deploy.sh production
```

### Step 4: SSL Certificate Setup
```bash
# SSH to server
ssh user@your-server

# Install Let's Encrypt certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com -d www.your-domain.com

# Verify auto-renewal
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```
